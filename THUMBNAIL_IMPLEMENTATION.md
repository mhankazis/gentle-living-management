### üé® Visual Improvements

   - Small thumbnail images (6x6 pixels) for quick variant preview
   - Color-coded borders matching product categories
   - Backdrop blur effects for modern glass morphism look

2. **Animation Effects**
   - Smooth scale transitions on hover
   - Image zoom effects on product hover
   - Price change animations when switching variants

3. **Smart Image Mapping**
   - Intelligent product name matching to image codes
   - Fallback to placeholder images for unmapped products
   - Special handling for products without size variants

4. **Category-Specific Styling**
   - Each product type has unique color themes
   - Descriptive badges (Bestseller, Herbal, Natural, Health, etc.)
   - Consistent visual hierarchy across all products

### üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

- **CSS Animations**: Custom CSS for smooth transitions and hover effects
- **Responsive Grid**: Flexbox and Grid layouts for proper thumbnail positioning
- **Performance Optimized**: Lazy loading considerations and efficient image switching

### üîÑ How It Works

1. **Product Name Analysis**: JavaScript analyzes product names to determine the base image code
2. **Variant Generation**: Creates array of size variants with corresponding images and prices
3. **Dynamic Display**: Renders thumbnail navigation and updates main image on selection
4. **Price Calculation**: Automatically calculates prices based on size multipliers
5. **Special Handling**: Twin packs get special treatment with pack variants instead of sizes

For Twin Pack products:
